Backbone Boilerplate
====================

This boilerplate is the product of much research and frustration.  Existing
boilerplates exist that modify Backbone core, don't have a build process, or
are very prescriptive; this boilerplate changes that.

Organize your application in a logical filesystem, develop your
Models/Collections/Views/Routers inside modules, and build knowing you have
efficient code that will not bottleneck your users.

## Provides ##

* HTML5 Boilerplate foundation
* Elegant filesystem structure for
  + App code, assets, tests, and distribution
* Snippets to make common tasks easier
  + For modules, HTML5 History API/Hash navigation, loading templates and
  application events
* Very flexible and pluginable build process that works in Windows! 
  + Concatenate and minify all your libraries, application code, templates and
  CSS
  + Compiles underscore templates out of the box

## Installation ##

There are several ways to install and intimately enjoy the benefits Backbone
Boilerplate provides.  The easiest is to download an archive and extract
into your new application folder:

* **[Download ZIP](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/zipball/master)**
* **[Download TAR](https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate/tarball/master)**

If you would rather use git, you can simply:

``` bash
cd myproject
git clone https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone-boilerplate.git .
rm -rf .git
```

This will download the latest boilerplate into your application directory
and clean out all the unnecessary git remnants.

If you would like to use the *ahem* awesome bundled build tool, you will
need to install Node.js for your platform.  Don't worry! It's super easy now!
If not, you can simply delete the build folder.

Navigate to: http://nodejs.org/ and click Download.  Once you've downloaded
scroll down to the Build section to see how to configure and use it.

## Tutorial ##

Once you have the boilerplate downloaded and extracted, run the following:

``` bash
node build/server
```

And launch your web browser to `http://localhost:8000/`, this will
load up the tutorial.

## HTML5 Boilerplate ##

This boilerplate started with an HTML5 Boilerplate base.  It has been stripped
of most of the comments and files, which you can see by visiting the H5BP repo.

https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate

## Filesystem Structure ##

This structure is very basic and yet offers many advantages such as isolation
of concerns whereas libraries and application code are separated completely.

Application code and templates are placed inside the `app` directory.  The
`index.js` file serves as the entry-point into the application and defines
the namespace as well as initializing the main application Router.  **Make
sure you change the namespace name here.**

The static assets are placed inside the `assets` directory.  The H5BP files
are already included here.  Place all new JavaScript libraries inside the
`assets/js/libs` directory.  If you are dealing with many jQuery plugins,
you may want to create a separate `plugins` folder inside `assets/js`.

**Default structure:**

```
.
├── app
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── modules
│   └── templates
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   ├── img
│   └── js
├── build
├── favicon.ico
├── index.html
└── test
```

## Modules ##

Modules are placed in the `app/modules/` directory.  There is an example module
there named: `example.js`.  The actual module definition function is located
inside the `app/index.js` file.  You create and reference modules with the same
function call:  `namespace.module("<module_name>")`.

Typically a module contains a single Model/Collection/Router and many Views.
Therefore the returned module object is empty except for a Views object
property that can be used to attach many Views to, like:

``` javascript
MyModule.Views.Detailed = Backbone.View.extend({ /* ... */ });

MyModule.Views.Main = Backbone.View.extend({ /* ... */ });
```

Attaching Models/Collections/Routers happen on the same level of the module,
like so:

``` javascript
MyModule.Model = Backbone.Model.extend({ /* ... */ });

MyModule.Router = Backbone.Router.extend({ /* ... */ });
```

## HTML5 History and Hash Based Navigation ##

Out the box Backbone Boilerplate enables `pushState`.  It also supplies a script
inside `app/index.js` which attaches a click handler that monitors all links and
will automatically route all *relative* urls through your Backbone application.

It is designed to only route urls that are defined inside your `app.Router` and
not Routers that may be defined elsewhere.

*Absolute* urls such as `http://google.com/` will be routed normally.  So if
your application contains links to pages or files that you do not want to 
route through Backbone's router, make them absolute.

In order to test `pushState` use the development server explained below.

## Development server ##

While writing an application that leverages `pushState` you can run the
following command to run a server that will always resolve to the `index.html`

``` bash
node build/server
```

This will spawn up an HTTP server on port `8000`.  This server is intended
for development and not production.  You should use url rewriting or forwarding
all requests in your production server to achieve this same effect. 

### Serving the built assets ###

If you are using the build tool in conjunction with this development server
you can optionally update the `index.html` file to remove the existing script
tags and uncomment out the scripts tag at the bottom to load the `dist/debug`
or `dist/release` assets.  You can achieve this by specifying either **debug**
or **release** after the server command, like so:

``` bash
node build/server release
```

## Build Process ##

The Backbone Boilerplate build process is a state-of-the-art, task-driven
Node.js application that utilizes [@cowboy's](http://github.com/cowboy/)
[grunt](https://github.com/cowboy/grunt) project.

To run the defaults, execute the following command from the project root,
and *not from inside the build folder*.

``` bash
node build
```

This will do a number of things for you.  First it will concatenate all your
libs, app code, and templates into separate files inside the `dist/debug`
folder.  It will then minify those files and your CSS into production ready
files inside the `dist/release` folder.

To customize and configure the build tool, open `build/config.js` and tweak
the settings.

If you are perpetually working on the application and making many changes, you
may find it convenient to have the build process watch your directory structure
and automatically re-run the tasks after a file has changed.

Use the following command to build to the debug folder:

``` bash
node build watch
```

Use the following command to build to the debug and release folders:

``` bash
node build watch:min
```

These watch commands can operate in parallel to the above development server
for an efficient work process of editting files and testing the output.

### Additional Build Tasks ###

The build process incorporates a plugin architecture that makes adding premade
or custom-built tasks very easy.

#### Installing custom tasks ####

To install a custom task, simply copy the JavaScript file into the `build/tasks`
folder.  If the task is an archive simply extract it into the same folder.

After the task has been loaded into the tasks directory, you will need to
configure it in `build/config.js` per the task instructions.

#### Creating custom tasks ####

Until proper tutorials and documentation have been created for Grunt, look
at the `build/tasks/__template.js` file for inspiration =)
